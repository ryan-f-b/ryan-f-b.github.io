# FlexBox Company Codecademy Project

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a new website for a fictional company from scratch. I created a homepage for 'Rajan's Bakery', making use of flexbox and responsive design to ensure the website is accessible on any device. The project was very enjoyable and strengthened my knowledge in Flexbox significantly.
